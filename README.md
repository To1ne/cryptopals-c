# cryptopals-c
My (unofficial) solutions to the [matasano cryptopals challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)
(written in C).

## SSL libary

As SSL implementation I have chosen PolarSSL. It is an uprising library
which I wanted to learn more about.

## Pure C

These solutions are written in plain C. I really wanted to improve my
C skills (because I have a C++ background). So these challenges were perfect
to do this.

## Instructions

You need to compile the PolarSSL library, by running `make` in the "polarssl"
directory.
After that, each challenge can be compiled by the command `make main` in each challenge
directory, and to run it, execute `./main`.
